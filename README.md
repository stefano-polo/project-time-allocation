This project is an engine that aims to optimize project time allocation using the Simplex method. The Simplex method is a widely used mathematical optimization technique for linear programming problems. By applying the Simplex method, the engine can determine the optimal allocation of time resources to different project activities, maximizing efficiency and minimizing project duration.
