Welcome to our web application, a powerful tool designed for efficient project management and optimized project allocation strategies. Our engine leverages the renowned Simplex method, a widely adopted mathematical optimization technique for linear programming problems.

With the Simplex method at its core, our engine excels at identifying the ideal portfolio of projects based on several key factors, such as available resources, project costs, and expected returns. This enables you to make informed decisions and prioritize projects that will yield the best outcomes given your constraints.

Experience the benefits of streamlined project allocation and unleash the full potential of your resources with our web application. Start optimizing your projects today!
